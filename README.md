# Taylor Recipes
A recipe website displaying the finest Taylor cuisine. The plan will be to start off small but continue to add recipes each time I find a new one that I like.

## Why am I starting this?
Well, the main reason is due to the Odin Project. They've told me that I need to do this to continue! So, I thought I would.

This will allow me to practice the HTML that I have learned so far. I think I have it down!

## What does the future look like?
Well, Odin Project suggests coming back to this in the future when we know some CSS to make it pretty. Which I plan on doing. However, in the longrun, I will continue working on this for all to see.
